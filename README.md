# ASYNCHRONOUS PROGRAMMING

## Introduction 

* JavaScript is synchronous and single threaded. If you're executing a block of code then no other JavaScript on that page will be executed until the block is complete.

* **Real Life Example** is a person who multi-tasks (Asynchronous) opposed to doing one thing at a time (Synchronous).

  * **Asynchronous Example:** If your on the phone you can also make coffee and toast at the same time. You would put coffee in the pot, walk to the toaster, and pop in the toast while waiting for the coffee to brew.

  * **Synchronous Example:** Is the opposite of Asyncrhonous and performs operations one thing at a time. Imaging how long it woudl take if we didn't start breakfast until after getting off the phone, or if we didn't pop in the toast until the coffee was completely brewed. This would take a really long time. 

* **JavaScript Example:** Imagine an AJAX request is made to the server, the page stops loading and doesn't continue to load the rest of the page until the request is complete. This can potentially take a long time and make the program feel stuck. You would lose web traffic because the website isn't optimized.
